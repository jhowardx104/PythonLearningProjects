# Goals

- Diagnose a patient's state of dehydration
  - Questions are all binary
  - Response determines what question is asked next
  - final diagnoses:
    - no dehydration
    - some dehydration
    - severe dehydration
- Keep track of and print all diagnoses
  - storing a list of all patients and diagnoses
  - the list is accessible to us
  - we can add new diagnoses to the list
  - Diagnosis format: "Patient_Name - diagnosis"
