## Lessons

### Code Generation

- Prompt the AI to generate code in almost any language you choose.
- You can use plain language or pseudocode.
- You can use it to add comments to your existing code.
- You can use it to convert a code snippet from one language to another.
- You can use it to generate placeholder data.
  - Can also be used to pull data from the internet.

#### Example Prompts
```text
Write a python script to do the following:

import an image, extract a color palette, dump 5 colors to the console
```

```text
Initialize a Python dictionary using the following values:

1, 2, 3, ...
```

```text
Add comments to the following code that a beginner will understand:

...
```

```text
Convert the following code from Python to C#:

...
```

```text
Generate a 15 record CSV file with this placeholder data:

username, password, email, ...
```

```text
Generate a python dictionary for each country in Europe with the value representing the country's population.
```

### Code Optimization

- Can be used to shrink code size, remove redundancy, and reinforce best practices.
  - This will often include details on what can be optimized and why it can be. Helps you learn why the change makes sense.
- Can be used to extract parent classes - promotes better inheritance/polymorphism
- Can be used to reinforce code standards
- Can be used to help break code down (single responsibility principle)

#### Example Prompts
```text
Optimize this Python code:

...
```

```text
Format this code to meet the C# coding standards:

...
```

```text
What are the main things to keep in mind when coding in C# with regards to coding standards?
```

```text
The following script is too large. Can you break it into smaller classes?

...
```

### Development Tools

- Can be used to write a git commit message for your code changes.
- Can be used to write a gitignore file for a project
- Can be used to write unit testing
- Can be used to generate documentation
- Can be used to learn more about frameworks and libraries
- Can be used to help structure your projects

#### Example Prompts
```text
Write a Git commit message for the following code:

...
```

```text
Write a Git commit message for the changes made to the following code.

Here is the current version:

...


Here is the version with my changes:
